00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.937
[MUSIC] Welcome to Section 4 of the 
course. 

2
00:00:02.937 --> 00:00:07.537
This is going to be the last section 
where ML is our primary programming 

3
00:00:07.537 --> 00:00:12.237
language, so I thought a short 
introduction just to remind us where we 

4
00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:15.162
are and where we're going would be 
helpful. 

5
00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:18.337
So we've done most of what we need to do 
with ML. 

6
00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:22.532
We've studied pattern matching, Haro 
functions, closures. 

7
00:00:22.532 --> 00:00:26.035
All the main, big topics. 
But there's 4 things that I put off, just 

8
00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:30.279
because we didn't need them for the 
homework, but I think complete our proper 

9
00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.727
introduction to this first half of the 
course. 

10
00:00:32.727 --> 00:00:36.433
So in this section, which may end up 
being a little bit shorter than the 

11
00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:40.289
others, we're going to study type 
inference, how ML has has been able to 

12
00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.145
figure out, what types all our functions 
and bindings should have. 

13
00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:47.243
mutual recursion. 
I just never showed you how to have 

14
00:00:47.243 --> 00:00:49.980
multiple recursive functions all call 
each other. 

15
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.112
The big topic I'm most excited about is 
the module system. 

16
00:00:53.112 --> 00:00:56.612
How we're going to be able to write 
modules that can hide things, 

17
00:00:56.612 --> 00:01:00.704
keep things private from other parts of 
the program and ML has a very elegant 

18
00:01:00.704 --> 00:01:04.206
module system for that purpose. 
We will do just the basics of it. 

19
00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:08.239
And then a discussion, it's more 
conceptual, about when two functions in a 

20
00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:12.052
language like ML are equivalent and you 
can replace one with another. 

21
00:01:12.052 --> 00:01:16.255
Now this section is not going to have a 
homework assignment associated with it. 

22
00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:20.732
we have time in the course for I believe 
7 homework assignments and we will have 8 

23
00:01:20.732 --> 00:01:24.098
or possibly 9 sections. 
And that will give us more time to study 

24
00:01:24.098 --> 00:01:27.942
for the mid-term which sort of fits 
nicely at the end of this section. 

25
00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:31.702
So the midterm will have short answer 
questions covering all of the first 4 

26
00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:35.572
sections, including some questions on 
this material, as well as the earlier 

27
00:01:35.572 --> 00:01:38.132
sections. 
And then after that we'll move onto more 

28
00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:41.597
concepts, and we'll switch our 
programming language to Racket cause 

29
00:01:41.597 --> 00:01:44.880
it'll be better suited for the concepts 
we want to cover with that.
